# AERITH_for_MATLAB
 
# Explanation & Features

"AERITH" is a practical algorithm for in silico metabolic design optimization. 
AERITH eliminates the need to solve complex mixed-integer optimization problems,
and instead identifies optimal combinations of metabolic reaction deletions by solving a simple linear programming problem. 
Compared with other commonly used methods, AERITH rendered accurate results in just minutes instead of hours.
 
# Demo

This AERITH script is applied for the genome scale model of iJO1366, a representative metabolic model of Escherichia coli.
As an example, a simulation for combination of reaction deletions for succinate production can be performed.
